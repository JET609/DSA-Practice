SA Practice – Jayanth

This repository is my personal space where I practice Data Structures & Algorithms consistently.
I started this mainly to improve my problem-solving skills and build a strong foundation for interviews and competitive programming.

Instead of just copying solutions, I'm trying to understand the logic behind each problem and write explanations in my own words.
My approach is simple: start with a brute-force idea, learn from mistakes, then optimize step by step.

💡 Why I'm doing this

I used to struggle with consistency and logical thinking, so I decided to commit publicly and track real progress here.
This repo will grow slowly, problem by problem — but with genuine learning behind every solution.

🔥 Recent Progress

Two Sum (Arrays) — Implemented brute force first to understand the idea; later optimized with Hash Map (O(n)).
Took some time to debug handling of duplicate values but it feels solid now.

🌟 Next Goals

Continue Arrays problems (Prefix Sum, Kadane's Algorithm, Sliding Window)

Start LinkedList basics

Add detailed explanations and comments inside solution files
